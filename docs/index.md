The "Self Organizing Recurrent Network Simulator" allows you to create different Neuron-Groups, define their Behaviour and connect them with Synapse-Groups.

With this Simulator you can create all kinds of biological plausible networks, which, for example, mimic the learning mechanisms of cortical structures.
